# Usage: scoop bucket [<SUBCOMMAND>] [<OPTIONS>] [<NAME> [<REPOSITORY>]]
# Summary: Manage local scoop buckets.
# Help: Add, list or remove buckets.
#
# Buckets are repositories of manifests available to install. Scoop comes with
# a default (main) bucket, but you can also add buckets that you or others have
# published.
#
# To add a bucket:
#   scoop bucket add <NAME> [<REPOSITORY>]
# eg:
#   scoop bucket add Ash258 https://github.com/Ash258/Scoop-Ash258.git
#   scoop bucket add extras
#
# To remove a bucket:
#   scoop bucket rm versions
# To list all known buckets, use:
#   scoop bucket known
#
# Subcommands:
#   add             Add a new bucket.
#   list            List all locally added buckets. Default subcommand when none is provided.
#   known           List all buckets, which are considered as "known" and could be added without providing repository URL.
#   rm              Remove an already added bucket.
#
# Options:
#   -h, --help      Show help for this command.
